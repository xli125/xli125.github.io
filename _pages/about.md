I study how genomic instability, lineage plasticity, and extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) drive prostate cancer evolution and resistance to targeted therapy. My work integrates functional genomics, organoid models, genome engineering, and single-cell and spatial omics to uncover how endogenous mutational processes and chromatin remodeling reshape tumor cell fate and therapeutic response.

I am currently an Associate Research Scientist in cancer biology, focusing on mechanisms of therapy resistance in advanced prostate cancer. My recent research revealed how loss of CHD1 induces chromatin dysregulation and heterogeneous resistance trajectories, and how loss of the RNA-binding protein SYNCRIP unleashes APOBEC-driven mutagenesis, tumor heterogeneity, and resistance to AR-targeted therapies. Ongoing work investigates how ecDNA contributes to immune modulation and adaptive resistance using patient-derived organoids and in vivo models.

I completed my training in molecular and cancer biology across China and the United States, with a long-standing interest in connecting fundamental mechanistic insights to new therapeutic strategies for patients with advanced solid tumors.
